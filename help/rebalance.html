<h4>Annual Rebalancing Strategy</h4>
<p>These are a selection of strategies that can be used to adjust the allocation over
time.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>None</b> Your portfolio will drift to different percentages depending on how each asset class performs.</li>
    <li><b>Constant</b> Your portfolio will automatically rebalance each year to match your initially chosen asset
        allocation.</li>
    <li><b>Glide Path</b> You will choose a target allocation that is different from your initial one (For example, you
        want to go from 80%/20% stocks/bonds to 60%/40% stocks and bonds in retirement). You will then choose a "Start
        Year" and "End Year" to execute this allocation change. Your allocation will slowly change to the target
        allocation over the course of those years.</li>
    <li><b>Bonds First</b> Annual spending is taken from the bonds portion, leaving the equities portion allone, until
        all the bonds have been used up. Then the equities are spent. The actual order is Cash > Gold > Bonds >
        Equities.</li>
    <li><b><a href="http://daveleemn.tripod.com/omega_strategy.htm">OmegaNot</a></b> Annual spending is taken from the
        equities portion as long as the equities are worth as much as or better than their initial inflation adjusted
        value. Otherwise the spending is taken from the bonds/gold/cash portion.</li>
</ul>
